# **MOUSE FRAME - Tool Information**

This program accepts images of walking pattern from mice. These images are used to analyze walking behaviour of these animals that is further used for comparison studies between healthy and sick mice. 
These comparison studies are usually done when studying diseases that affect the brain, such as neurodefenrative diseases and others that may affect motor functions.

Example of one of these pieces of paper (already digitized):

![example mice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2a2e9a8-a5ec-4ac7-9bf2-8f45d67a7f60)


How are these images obtained?
1. Scientists paint the mice paws and make them walk on top of a piece of paper
2. After getting this long piece of paper, scientists are required to measure every single one of the measurements by hand/ruler which is an exhaustive task.

Mouseframe helps mitigate that problem. It is only required digitalization of those pieces of paper for usage in this application.

The front paws of the mice are marked in red and the hind paws in blue. This analysis goes through 8 different types of measurements. The 8 measures are the following:

The image above not only shows the 8 measurements, but also shows indicators of how the 2D graph works in this application:
1. Origin is on the top left corner of every image
2. X increases from left to right from that same corner
3. Y increases top to bottom from that same corner


For detailed information of how every measurement is calculated there is an info page in this application.
